				</p>
				<p>
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
					websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law‚Äôs reach
					stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
					United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites
					collecting personally identifiable information from California
					consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
					exactly the information being collected and those individuals with
					whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

					easily be found on the home page of our website;

					Privacy Policy Page;
				</p>

					0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing
					us at <strong>hyperfour.co@gmail.com</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>Our Policy on ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù Signals:</p>
				<p>
					We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use
					advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not
					Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform
					websites that you do not want to be tracked.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or
					Settings page of your web browser.
